Spellchecker
============
An awful Spellchecker done up in Java (poorly)

Implemented using hashtables rather than the traditional trie, while still providing spelling suggestions.  The idea is interesting, but the implementation is actually pretty awful, as it was one of the first projects I worked on after my intro. to Java course.

I hope to revisit this one day and make it better.
